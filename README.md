# ContactList_with_MVP
Project architect with MVP, Dagger2, RxAndroid, Retrofit2.

The Model-View-Presenter design pattern is a modern pattern to seperate the view from the underlying model. MVP is a derivative of the model–view–controller (MVC) software pattern, also used mostly for building user interfaces.


Dependency injection using Dagger2 is a software design pattern focused on making our applications loosely coupled, extensible, and maintainable.

RxJava is a port from Netflix of the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to Java. RxJava was open sourced 2014 and is hosted at http://reactivex.io/.

RxAndroid is port for Android of RxJava.
